Hello Humanity!

I am new to the coding world and am excited to put what I learn to the test. One day, I would like to focus my career on coding and wishi to give my family everything they deserve. This may be a long ways away, however, I will stay focused and push myself as far as I need to. I am a musician, animal lover, gamer and a nice guy. I love working outdoors and also like to make people happy. 

Please help me in any and all ways as I am completely open to feed back and constructive criticism.
